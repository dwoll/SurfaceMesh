# SurfaceMesh: 3D surface meshes based on `CGAL`

`SurfaceMesh` is an R package that supports basic processing of 3D surface meshes using as backend the C++ library [`CGAL`](https://www.cgal.org/) via R package [`RcppCGAL`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppCGAL). Features:

  * Read in and write mesh files in common formats (STL, PLY, OBJ, OFF)
  * Conversion to / from class `mesh3d` from package [`rgl`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rgl), also compatible with package [`Rvcg`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rvcg)
  * Mesh repair
      * Filling holes
      * Removing self intersections
  * Boolean mesh operations
      * Union
      * Dfference
      * Intersection
  * Isotropic remeshing
  * Smoothing
  * Subdivision
      * Catmull-Clark
      * Doo-Sabin
      * Sqrt3
      * Loop
  * Surface reconstruction
      * AFS
      * SSS
      * Poisson
      * Alpha wrapping
  * Bounding box
      * Axis-parallel bounding box
      * Optimal (oriented) bounding box
  * Convex hull
  * Distance from points to mesh
  * Centroid (center of mass)
  * Surface area
  * Volume
  * Vertex normals
  * Randomly sampling points on a mesh

The package also calculates distance and similarity metrics for a given pair of 3D surface meshes (see [dkfz metrics reloaded](https://metrics-reloaded.dkfz.de/metric-library)):

  * Distance between the two respective centers of mass (DCOM)
  * Hausdorff distance
      * Approximate
      * Bounded error
      * Quantile (e.g., 'HD95')
  * Average symmetric surface distance (ASSD)
  * Root mean squared error (RMSE, with respect to the surface)
  * Jaccard Similarity Coefficient (JSC, aka 'Intersection over Union', IoU)
  * Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)

## Implementation

This package includes code adapted from packages [`Boov`](https://github.com/stla/Boov/), [`PolygonSoup`](https://github.com/stla/PolygonSoup/), and [`cgalMeshes`](https://github.com/stla/cgalMeshes/) developed and copyright by [Stéphane Laurent](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/).  Currently, only a subset of the functionality of these packages is provided in `SurfaceMesh`.

A fork / adaptation of packages [`Boov`](https://github.com/stla/Boov/), [`PolygonSoup`](https://github.com/stla/PolygonSoup/), and [`cgalMeshes`](https://github.com/stla/cgalMeshes/) was carried out as upstream changes to CGAL introduced incompatibilities, and the packages were archived from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

The design was chosen such that mesh data resides in R space. This means that for each mesh operation, data is first transferred to the C++ side (using `Rcpp`), converted to a CGAL surface mesh, subjected to CGAL functions, and then transferred back to R. The package does not maintain a pointer to a C++ data structure to keep the mesh data there - unlike packages such as [`terra`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=terra) or [`cgalMeshes`](https://github.com/stla/cgalMeshes/). This approach carries a performance penalty, but from an R perspective, it is more straightforward. In particular, there are no serialization issues (saving meshes). Furthermore, memory management is easier.
